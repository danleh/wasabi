// This is optimized away, because constants are not materialized into variables, so the constant
// is just pushed to the (implicit during conversion) variable stack.
// s0: i32 = i32.const 3
call f1 (i32.const 7)
// s0 is dropped here, 
// but because drop of variable references is optimized, no statement is actually produced
